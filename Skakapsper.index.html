    <h1>Shall i compare thee to a summer's day?</h1>

    <p><i>by William Shakespear</i> <br>
        <br />
        Shall i compare thee to a summer's day? <br>
        Thou are more <i>lovely </i>and more <strong>temperate:</strong><br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, <br>
        And summer's lease hath all too short a<sup>date</sup>:<br>
        <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines. <br>
        And often is his gold complexion<sub> dimm'ds-</sub>, <br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br>
        By chace, or nature's changing course untrimm'd: <br>
        <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br>
        When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<br>
        So long as men can breathe. or eyes can see, <br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee<br></p>
